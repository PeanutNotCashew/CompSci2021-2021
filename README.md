These are my projects from my Computer Science class.

## Units
* Unit 1: Web Science
* Unit 2: HTML
* Unit 3: CSS
* Unit 4: JavaScript
* Unit 5: JQuery
* Unit 6: Java
* Unit 7: Object-Oriented Programming

## Notes
Here are my top tips for coding:
* Don't be afraid to google! At least half of the stuff I code, I find on Google and Stack Overflow.
* Comment on your code. If you try to look at your code even a week later, you probably won't know what you even did. Comments make code more understandable and helps other people (and you) understand what it does.
* Consistently test your code. You don't want to finish an entire project, and then find out it won't work because of some obscure error, and then crawl through all of your code to see why it won't work. (Or find out that it crashes your computer üëç)

### My Steps to Debugging
1. Check for missing semicolons or spelling errors
2. Use the Inspect tool to find the error
3. Google error message to find problem
4. Use console.log(); to further pinpoint what is causing the error
If all above steps fail, try another method of carrying out the assigned task. You can also ask someone else, or use sites like Stack Overflow to ask a stranger.
